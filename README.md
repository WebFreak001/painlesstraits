painlesstraits
==============

This module provides a few helper templates to make working with [dlang][]'s [User Defined Attributes][] just a bit nicer.

Inspired and derived from templates found in the [painlessjson][] project.

[dlang]: http://dlang.org
[User Defined Attributes]: http://dlang.org/attribute.html#uda
[painlessjson]: https://github.com/BlackEdder/painlessjson/blob/2c0a8245eefc83da044a89ff833199da136af262/source/painlessjson/traits.d
